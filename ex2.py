# 这个练习主要是练习注释（#）的使用方法
# # 英文 octothorpe 或者 pound character

# A comment, this is so you can read your program later.

# Anything after the # is ignored by python.

print('I could have code like this .') # and the comment after is ignored.

# You can also use a comment to "disable" or comment out a piece of code:

# print('This won't run')

print ('This will run.')
